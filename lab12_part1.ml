(*
Objective:

This lab provides practice with reference types and their use in
building mutable data structures and in imperative programming more
generally. It also gives further practice in using modules to abstract
data types.

There are 4 total parts to this lab. Please refer to the following
files to complete all exercises:

-> lab12_part1.ml -- Part 1: Fun with references (this file)
   lab12_part2.ml -- Part 2: Gensym
   lab12_part3.ml -- Part 3: Appending mutable lists
   lab12_part4.ml -- Part 4: Adding serialization to imperative queues

                              IMPORTANT

As usual, when implementing functions in this lab, you shouldn't feel
beholden to how the definition is introduced in the skeleton code
below. For instance, you might want to add a `rec`, or use a different
argument list, or no argument list at all but binding to an anonymous
function instead. THIS IS ESPECIALLY PERTINENT TO CERTAIN PROBLEMS IN
THIS LAB, WHERE THE NORMAL COMPACT NOTATION FOR INTRODUCING FUNCTIONS
MAY NOT BE APPROPRIATE.
*********************************************************************)

(*====================================================================
Part 1: Fun with references

......................................................................
Exercise 1: Consider a function `incr` that takes an `int ref`
argument and has the side effect of incrementing the integer stored in
the `ref`. What is an appropriate type for the return value? What
should the type for the function as a whole be?
....................................................................*)

(* ANSWER: The function is called for its side effect, not to return
   an updated value, so the appropriate return type is `unit`. The type
   of the function is thus

     int ref -> unit
 *)

(*....................................................................
Exercise 2: Now implement the `incr` function.
....................................................................*)

let incr (n : int ref) : unit =
  n := !n + 1 ;;

(* As it turns out, the `incr` function is provided as part of the
   `Stdlib` module. Now you know how it can be implemented. *)

(*....................................................................
Exercise 3: Write a function `remember` that returns the last string
that it was called with. The first time it is called, it should return
the empty string.

    # remember "don't forget" ;;
    - : string = ""
    # remember "what was that again?" ;;
    - : string = "don't forget"
    # remember "etaoin shrdlu" ;;
    - : string = "what was that again?"

(This is probably the least "functional" function ever written!)

As usual, you shouldn't feel beholden to how the definition is
introduced in the skeleton code below.
....................................................................*)

let remember : string -> string =
  let memory = ref "" in
  fun (msg : string) -> let previous = !memory in
                        memory := msg;
                        previous 
                     ;;

(* An alternative is to move the `memory` variable outside the
   function definition, as:

    let memory = ref "" ;;

    let remember msg =
      let previous = !memory in
      memory := msg;
      previous ;;

   But this allows access to the contents of `memory` outside the
   `remember` function, which is a failure of the abstraction that
   `remember` is intended to implement, violating the edict of
   prevention.

   A common error is to start the function as would be typical given
   its signature:

    let remember msg =
    ...

   and then introduce the `memory` variable

    let remember msg =
      let memory = ref "" in
      ...
     
   finally finishing with the update and return value

    let remember msg =
      let memory = ref "" in
      let previous = !memory in
      memory := msg;
      previous ;;

   Unfortunately, this version introduces a new `memory` each time
   it's called, so always returns the empty string.  *)
